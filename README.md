Good Enough Network Tool

This program works on an Arduino Mega with a 16x2 LCD panel and a standard Ethernet shield. 
Because of the program size and the number of pins required I don't think it'll work with an Uno.

It will do the following:
- Get an IP address
- Allow you to assign an IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS
- Ping any IP address
- "Discover" via ping a range of IP addresses and display them
- Do a basic port scan on a specific IP
- Turn on and off the backlight

As I learn more, I'll throw new features in.
